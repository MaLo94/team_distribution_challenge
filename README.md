# team_distribution_challenge
In this project, we want to find a good way of dividing our managers into a specific number of team (``` parameter k ```) and manage them to have responsibility for different areas in an optimized way. 

## Getting Started
We want to use one of the most reliable clustering algorithms called ```Kmeans```. Actually, We need to find a way to distribute each team to the proper cluster, in order to make the cost of transportation lower and lower.
But in this case, our main goal is to implement the algorithm from scratch (using ```scikit-learn``` prepared modules are forbidden) 

### Prerequisites
We forced to use just these libraries:
*[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html) - pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language
*[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
*[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - NumPy brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use
